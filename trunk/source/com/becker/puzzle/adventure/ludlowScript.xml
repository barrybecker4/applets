           The double door is unlocked and opens easily.\n
           The beam of your flashligh reveals an empty hallway with a mirror at the opposite end. \n
           There are openings that lead to rooms on the right and left.\n
               The hall has inch-thick red carpeting\n
           and walnut-paneled walls. The mirror at the end runs from the\n
           floor to the twenty-foot-high ceiling and covers the forty feet of wall\n
           section on that south face of the hall.

overstuffed relic with several cushions and rips on all parts of it. The\n
room measures sixty feet east and west and forty feet north and\n
south, if paced out.
There is a door on the east side of the room.

crates of differing sizes, and the biggest concentration of leaves is in\n

south starting on the east wall that is forty feet long east and west and\n
twenty feet long north and south; it is here that the concentration of\n

   The beam of your flashlight shows a room with gray painted\n
walls and a cement floor. It is filled with boxes and barrels.\n
   There are thirteen barrels of grain\n
alcohol each with the number \"50\" painted on it. There are thirteen\n
boxes filled with pairs of white gloves. A metal chest contains a silver\n
set made to serve eighteen people, four pairs of silver candlesticks,\n
three huge silver carving knives (like short swords), and eighteen\n
solid silver goblets (total worth of the silver items is 20,000 silver\n
pieces). There are thirteen chests filled with books about plants;\n
thirteen boxes filled with assorted sizes of clay pots; and ten large\n
crates with mattresses in them. When paced out, the room is forty\n
feet wide east and west and sixty feet wide north and south. A door\n
on the east wall is originally hidden by the mattress crates.\n
    When you enter the room,\n
are immediately attacked by an incredibly old man dressed in\n
rags and carrying a butcher knife (HP: 7; #AT: 1; 0: 1-6; AC: 10; SA:\n
None). This old man leaps out from behind some of the boxes and\n
