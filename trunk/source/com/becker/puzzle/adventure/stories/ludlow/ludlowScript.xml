 There are openings that lead to rooms on the left and right.
 The hall has inch-thick red carpeting and walnut-paneled walls.

 and covers the forty feet of wall section on that south face of the hall.

There are leaves on the floor, and an old worn out couch in the north east corner. There is a musty smell to the room, and leaves are littered on the floor.

It is filled with wooden crates and there are leaves all over the room in large piles.
There are 200 empty wooden crates of differing sizes, and the biggest concentration of leaves is in the southwest corner of the room.
The room measures sixty feet east and west and forty feet north and south and has a side alcove to the south starting on the east wall that is forty feet long east and west and twenty feet long north and south. 
It is here that the concentration of leaves is located. Behind a big crate along the east wall, thirty feet from the north corner, one finds a door with a normal handle.

an oaken floor that is filled with shelves upon shelves of rocks. From
the door, a set of stairs is visible going up from the south section of
the room.
These shelves are obviously a
geological exhibit of some type, since every sample of rock has a
scientific name on it. Each of the samples weighs about a pound. If
paced out, the room is sixty feet west and east with a partial wall
running north, starting twenty feet from the east wall and extending
forty feet. The room is eighty feet long north and south. On the west
wall in the north corner is a passageway out of the room. Also on that
wall, sixty feet from the north corner, is a doorway. Further down from
this door is a twenty by twenty feet corridor section that ends at the
bottom of the stairs up; on the east wall section by the stairs is
another way out of the room.</description>

(HP: 7; #AT: 1; 0: 1-6; AC: 10; SA:None). 
This old man leaps out from behind some of the boxes and surprises you.
He will never follow a retreating group out of the room, but will act dangerously at all other times and will never listen to any type of reason.</description>

It is filled with boxes and barrels.
There are thirteen barrels of grain alcohol each with the number "50" painted on it. 
There are thirteen boxes filled with pairs of white gloves. 
A metal chest contains a silver set made to serve eighteen people, four pairs of silver candlesticks, three huge silver carving knives (like short swords), and eighteen solid silver goblets (total worth of the silver items is 20,000 silver pieces).
There are thirteen chests filled with books about plants; thirteen boxes filled with assorted sizes of clay pots; and ten large crates with mattresses in them. When paced out, the room is forty feet wide east and west and sixty feet wide north and south.
A door on the east wall is originally hidden by the mattress crates.
