/**
 * Worker is an abstract class that you subclass to
 * perform (usually gui related) work in a dedicated thread.  For
 * instructions on and examples of using this class, see:
 * 
 * http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html
 *
 * You must invoke start() on the Worker after
 * creating it.
 * ----
 *   I have modified the original Worker class so that it no longer
 *  depends on Swing (hence the new name). I sometimes want to use this
 * class in a server process. So if you are using it on the gui make sure
 * that the body of the finished method is called from SwingUtilities.invokeLater().
