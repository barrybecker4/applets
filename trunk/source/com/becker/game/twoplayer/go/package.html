<h2>
A Go playing application</h2>
This package implements the game of Go using the game framework.
<br>If you have comments or questions send mail to BarryBecker4@yahoo.com
<p>Go is a game with simple rules, but can take a lifetime to master. Stones
are placed on the board one at a time and cannot be moved. There are only
4 simple rules are:
<ol>
<li>
When a group of stones is completely surrounded they are captured. Each
capture counts as 1 point at the end.</li>

<li>
Every empty space completely surrounded by a group of stomes of one color
counts as a point.</li>

<li>
The board cannot look like it did at any time in the past (rule of ko).</li>

<li>
When the 2 players have passed in succession, the game is over.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp; If you are not familiar with rules of go or the following terms,
see
<br>&nbsp; Mathematical Go by Berlekamp and Wolfe (appendix B).
<br>&nbsp; terms: liberty, atari, snapback, ko, seki, string, group, dame
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eye, false eye, big
eye, dead stone, independently alive group,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; territory, bent 4,
moyo, nobi, ikken tobi, nikken tobi, kogeima
<p>&nbsp; I will try to adhere to Modern Chinese rules.
<br>&nbsp; Here are the unique aspects of Chinese rules that differ from
other common rulesets:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) any suicide move is considered illegal
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) When you pass, your opponent gets a point.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For computer go, this is useful because
it forces
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision/completion of groups to help
determine life and death and a proper score.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) the game terminates when the 2 players pass consecutively
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) score = komi (5.5) + stones on board of player + player
territory (note: captures not counted)
<p>&nbsp;The computer keeps track of hierachies of stones. The pecking
order is:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stones - individual spaces. They can be empty or
occupied.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strings - tightly connected collections of stones
(nobi connections only)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groups - connected collections of strings (nikken
tobi, and kogeima)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; armies - loosely connected collections of groups
(still to do).

Here is a dependency diagram of the classes and subpages

<br>
<p>&nbsp;* Things still to do:
<br>&nbsp;* Estimated days to implement are in ()'s after each item. I
have about 4 hours in a day on the weekend.
<br>&nbsp;* This lists only grows. As I complete one task, I typically
add 2 more.
<br>&nbsp;* If the list grows no more, it will take me 8 months until I'm
finished at my current rate.
<br>&nbsp;* If I were to become unemployed, I would probably complete in
one-third the time.
<br>&nbsp;* In reality, I'll probably never finish. That's ok, I'm not
sure I want to. I enjoy doing it.
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - not playing final capturing move when it should on
a 5x5 board.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - dont play in an eye unless its a false eye
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - allow player to ask for suggested move (1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - show visualization of all next move values in main
and debug windows
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - implement accurate scoring (2)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - if the computer or player resigns, the playerWon vars
should be set and the strcngth of the win should be large.
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;** core algorithm improvements
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - determine end of game. Allow computer to resign.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - Computer should pass when appropriate. (not currently
working)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - proper scoring when the game is over (score what
it can, and allow for player dispute fo score).
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - implement armies (2)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - use runner up chaching (moves that were good
in the past are likely to be still good) (2)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - do automatic weight optimization so it can learn
to play better (4)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - add randomness to computer moves ( have option
since sometimes its undesirable) (1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - adhere to chinese rules, add other rulesets as
options. (4)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; - consider monkey jump connections.
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;**&nbsp; Packaging issues
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make this a web page
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - maintain on website as applet and webstart
(yahoo does not yet support webstart) (1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - cleanup all java doc (3)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - add html documentation describing architecture
(3)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make opensource (3)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - write a book about it. Targetting 12 year
olds. (30)
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;**&nbsp; Refactoring changes needed
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Done: use optimizer package instead of
local methods. Use ParameterArray instead of weights
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - use GameBoardPosition and GameBoardPosition
instead of just GamePieces
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - switch to using type safe enums instead
of int constants.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - alpha-beta and queiscent setter/getter
methods could be properties of the SearchStrategy instead of the game controller.
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;**&nbsp; UI features
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - gray &lt;&lt; >> buttons as appropriate
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - add resign button.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - show real and false eyes
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - show outline around groups
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - use images for stones and board background
(1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - add colormap ui component for when showing
color for health of groups
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - have female voice repeat all text if sound
on.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - run the search in a different thread so
we can quite while animating, and so we can update the game tree while
animating
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - show progress bar while computer thinks
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - visualize how pruning works. Animate the
game tree rendering. Use VCR like controls to control animation
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - option to send output log file, (console
and output window done). (1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - change to using menus instead of buttons
(maybe) (1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - add save button (and load in new sgf format
game) (1)
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - use kiseido for front end? (3)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - improve performance with profiling (1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - try compiling to a native executable with GCJ to improve
performance on windows.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - defaults for options should come from config/preferences
file rather than hardcode (1) (see jdk1.4 preferences)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - handle time limits and options (2)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - have it play automatically on Kiseido/IGS without intervention
(like many faces of go does) (4)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - allow playing over the net (4)
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;* Bugs and Verification:
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - after reloading an SGF file its the wrong player's
turn
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - reading an SGF should set the state of the game params
like board size
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - adding stones and strings to strings and groups that
already contain them.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - the toolbar is not the UI color (instead it is gray).
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - automatically run suite of regression tests. (2)
<br>&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;* Resolved bugs (check for regressions)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - kos' now being enforced.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - confirm computing eyes correctly (and health).
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - verify correctness of static evaluation weights and
worth function (2)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - confirm can play suicidal move when if captures enemy
stones (1)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - build in the rule of "ko" - i.e. no immediate takebacks
(2)
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - Give the applet more memory so it doesn't run out of
memory.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; - correct handling of snapbacks (1)
<br>&nbsp;*
