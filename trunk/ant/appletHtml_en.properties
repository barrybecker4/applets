appletHtml.en.introduction=\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this page you can play some of the java programs that I have \
developed. You can access them either as applets or through java Web Start.  \
To run the applets, you need to have IE 5.5+ or <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html">FireFox</a> 2.0+ \
and the java 1.6+ plugin. Not all of the features of these programs are \
available when run as unsigned applets, but most are. Send me e-mail if you \
have any difficulties. Many of the applets may require java 1.6+ so they can take advantage of the concurrency libraries.\
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \
You can group my programs into 3 main categories. Board \
games, simulations, and puzzles. I have created an infrastructure for \
creating games with perfect information (no chance involved). \
This makes it very easy to add new games of this type in the future. So \
far I have Pente, Tic-tac-toe, Checkers, Chess, Blockade, Set, Galactic, Poker, and Go, but could add more easily. The Go \
program still has a lot of room for improvement. \
All the games and simulations have an automatic optimization mode where they can improve \
by running repeatedly. All the games on this page use the strategy \
design pattern for determining how to search. This means it is easy \
to plug in alternative search algorithms. So far, I have implemented \
minimax, negamax, and negascout. Go will probably require a radically different \
search strategy in order to be successful, but for now these two search \
methods are a good starting point. If you look in the options you will see \
a way to show a visualization of the game tree while you are playing. \
This has proved instrumental while debugging, but also can be used to help \
understand how the computer "thinks". \
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \
I consider all of the programs here to still be in the early stages of \
development.  I have ideas all the time about things to simulate on the \
computer. I find it fascinating to discover how the computer can be used to \
solve problems. For some fraction of my ideas, I create \
implementations. I have only limited time on the weekends. All of the \
html pages in this section of the site are generated using an Ant script though \
I would like to move to <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a> soon. \
I have internationalized my source code and partially localized to 4 languages: \
<a href="applet_index_en.html">English</a>, \
<a href="applet_index_de.html">German</a>, \
<a href="applet_index_vi.html">Vietnamese</a>, \
<a href="applet_index_jp.html">Japanese</a>. \
At some point I hope to opensource the code and write a book about the experience of developing these programs. \
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \
I hope you will have half as much fun playing with these programs as I had \
writing them!

I used to play pente a lot with my wife when we first met (she is quite good at it). \
Pente is the first game that I created using my game framework.  I first created a Pascal version back in 1991, \
but this one is better. My motivation has been to make it good enough to beat my wife. The object of the game is \
to get 5 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). As with all the games created using this framework, \
you can play against the computer, another person, or have the computer play against itself.

blockade.en.longDescription=Blockade is a relatively new game created by Lakeside. \
I used to play it as a kid, but I don't see it in the stores anymore. \
Each player starts with two pawns on designated spaces near their side of the board. \
They each have (typically) ten blue walls and ten green walls, which fit in the slots \
between the grid squares and are two squares wide. A player's turn consists \
of moving his pawn two spaces and then placing a wall anywhere on the grid. \
The object is to get one of your pawns around the obstacles being set by your \
opponent and onto one of his or her starting spaces. \
It is illegal to block a pawn completely from being able to reach either goal.

piece has four nubs. There are no edge pieces. There are over 300,000 incorrect \
configurations. This applet will solve it in about 5,000 - 60,000 iterations. \
It shuffles the pieces so there is a different result each time. The search \
algorithm tries pieces until it finds one that doesn't fit. If none of \
the remaining pieces fit after all rotations have been tried, it backtracks \
one position and tries again. Its guaranteed to find a puzzlePanel if there \
is one. The letters indicate the shape of the nub: Heart, Diamond, Club \
or Spade. Maybe someday I will draw the pieces as they really look.

sudoku.en.name=sudoku
sudoku.en.title=Sudoku Puzzle
sudoku.en.description=\
Sudoku is the latest puzzle craze. I'm not all that good at solving them by hand, \
so I wrote a program to do it. My mother and I created the design together. \
She plays sudoku quite a bit and is very good at it. \
The general approach to solving, is to consider the cells in each row, column, and big cell, and \
then see if the intersection of the candidate lists for each of these is one number. \
If so fill it in. When you've done that for all cells, repeat. It usually only takes \
a few iterations to find the solution. Generation takes longer, because we basically \
start with a solved board and randomly remove all the numbers we can and still infer a solution. \
This means we have to solve the whole board each time we remove a number.

than 2 pegs and neither were in the center. This brute force simulation takes into account \
board symmetry and while searching it \
keeps track of the paths that it has tried and if it ever reaches a position that is has \
seen before it stops searching \
because it knows there is not a puzzlePanel by that route. \
As a result the similation is very memory intensive, so don't be surprised if it runs out of memory. \
It can take on the order of one hour to run.

When my son and I were watching Lord of the Rings, we noticed that Minas Tirith used trebuchets to defend itself. \
We built one out of lego, but optimizing lego is tedious, so I made this virtual \
trebuchet in order to try different designs. \
The trebuchet can also "learn" to move more efficiently by a process of automated optimization. \
It uses exactly the optimization code I use for improving the performance of the game programs. \
This is still a work in progress. I need to use constrained dynamics for the projectile's attachement to the sling \
(instead of a simple spring based restorative force which leads to instability). \
When done, I hope to build a trebuchet with my son according to the optimized specifications.

snake.en.longDescription=Simulate a living snake. The program uses a spring based model to represent the snake. \
There is a sinusoidal force function applied to each side to simulate muscular contractions. \
Directional friction is used to make the snake go forward (as happens with a real snake). \
Snakes have 4 ways of moving: rectilinear progression, horizontal undulatory progression, sindwinding, \
and concertina progression (rarely used). I only used the most common gait, horizontal undulatory progression, \
in this demo, but will probably add the others. You can also change \
the parameters of this gait to get different behaviors. \
The snake can also "learn" to move more efficiently by a process of automated optimization. \
It uses exactly the optimization code I use for improving the performance of the game programs. \
I now understand really well how a snake moves. Based on work by <a href="http://www.snakerobots.com/simulation.html">Gavin Miller</a>.

You invest $100,000 in a volatile stock. Each year, with equal probability, it either rises 60% or falls by 40%. \
You declare that your heirs are not to sell the stock for 100 years. What would be the expected stock value (mean) after 100 years? \
What would be  the median? What would be the mode?<br/> \
The expected value would be $1,378,000,000. If there are many stocks like this, the total market value will rise dramatically (value = expected * num_stocks)<br>\
100,000 * ((1.6+0.6)/2)^100 = 100,000 * 1.1^100 <br/>\
The mode and the median are both $13,000 (100,000 * (1.6)^50 * (0.6)^50). <br/>\
While on average you expect 10% return a year, the most likely scenario (mode) is that you'll end up with $13,000. \
Moreover, more than half the people will end up with $13,000 or less. \
The moral of the story is Diversify! Now you know why you hear that investment advice from the experts so often.

adventure.en.longDescription=This started as a really simple text based adventure. The scenes were stored in an xml file. \
I thought it would be cool to have images and sounds associated with the scenes, so I added a UI. \
When editing the xml file got tedious, I decided to add the graphical editor. \
Next I may add support for keeping track of found items and hit points. \
This story is based on a adventure in Dragon Magazine back in 1980.
