/**
 * A simple game tree for testing search strategies.
 * It looks something like this
 *                 ___[6]____
 *                /          \
 *             [-8]         [-2]
 *
 * Move scores are evaluated from player one's perspective.
 * So for this game, if player 1 is going first, he would bick the node on the right, even though it
 * is suspected to be a losing move (less than 0), but its better than the one on the left.
