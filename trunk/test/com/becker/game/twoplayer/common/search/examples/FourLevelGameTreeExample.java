/**
 * This example comes from one of the homework problems in Chapter 8 of
 * Artificial Intelligence for Games by Ian Millington and John Funge.
 *
 * It is a binary tree and all the search trees for all the strategies can be derived from
 * just the leaf nodes.
 *  [17][6]  [46][27]  [48][33]  [10][25] [22][1] [14][6] [2][12]  [24][48]
 *
 * Move scores are evaluated from player one's perspective.
 * Player 1 will want to select the left branch in order to have the best chance of winning, and
 * Player 2 will wan tthe right.
