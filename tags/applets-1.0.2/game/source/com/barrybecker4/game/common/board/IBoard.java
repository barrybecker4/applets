 * This is the interface that all game boards should implement.
 * We assume that the board is composed of a 2D array of BoardPositions.
 *
 * Providing both an interface and an abstract implementation is a pattern
 * which maximizes flexibility in a framework. The interface defines the
 * public contract. The abstract class may be package private if we don't
 * want to expose it. Or other classes may implement this interface without
 * extending the abstract base class.
