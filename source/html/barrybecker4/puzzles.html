A majority of 51% is needed to pass a measure. Even though one drives a Yugo, they have equal power. Now think of four holding: 27%, 26%, 25%, 22%. The last stockholder's vote is never crucial (dummy). Similarly, 45%, 44%, 7%, 4%. The first three have equal power, the 4th is a dummy. Banzhaf power index: # of ways to change a coalition. Using this can you figure out how 3 members of the supreme court could control the vote for all 9?<br><br></span></font><b><font face="Helvetica" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Body Temperature</span></font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">:&nbsp; The normal body temperature is believed to be 98.6 degrees Farenheit by most people in the US. However, it is 98.2 degrees. Why is this number wrong? Dr. Wunderlich measurements were in Celsius, and he rounded 36.8 to 37. People in the US liked to be more accurate, so they converted 37 Celsius to Farenheit, keeping an extra digit.<br><br></span></font><b><font face="Helvetica" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12">Cigarette smoking</span></font></b><font face="Helvetica" size="-1"><span style="font-size:12"> kills 400,000 Americans annually.

When President Bush goes from D.C. to Texas, the average IQ rises in both states (assuming his IQ is between the mean for each state). Median home sale prices are reported in the news, so when Larry Ellison moves, the value does not spike.<br> To compute statistics, you sample from some universe.

If you work full-time, your salary doubles.<br> <br> - The death rate in the Navy during the Spanish-American War (1898) was 9 per 1000<br>For Civilians in New York City during the same period it was 16 per thousand. <br>Groups are not comparable. <br>&nbsp; The Navy is made up mostly of young men in known good health <br>&nbsp; The civilian population includes infants, old, and ill people.&nbsp; <br><br> - In one study, 33% of women at Hopkins had married faculty members!
