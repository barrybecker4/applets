	<td><span style="font-size:14">- If a mother dresses up too much while pregnant then the baby will be born ugly.<br>- Life becomes complicated just when you make it complicated yourself.<br>- If you save a penny, you will have a dollar.<br>- If you have big ears and a big mouth, then you are a good person.<br>- Your feet are bigger in the morning.<br>- If you sneeze, it means that somebody somewhere is talking about you.<br>- If you eat burned chicken, you will get cancer.<br>- Its not good to shower after a big meal. It will make you sick.<br>- Don't take a shower when you&nbsp; are sick. It will make you feel worse.<br>- If your eyes are puffy, it means you saw dogs making love.<br>- If you have cold hands it means you are a cold (mean) person.<br>- If your pinky is much shorter than your ring finger, then it is very easy for your friends to control you.<br>- If your belly button is an outy, you will be poor because you can't store any money in your belly button.<br>- Putting a butterfly in you belly button can help you to learn to swim.<br>- When the wind blows in your belly button it can make you sick. When this happens, applying medicine oil to your belly button is the only cure.<br>- God gave a woman beauty so she could punish men.<br>- It is ok for a woman to steal from a man, but not the other way around. (Its only ok if the woman does not work).<br>- If you have long earlobes, then you will have a long life.<br>- If your fart makes big noise, then it will not smell much.<br>- If you have flecks under your finger nails it means you have just washed rice.<br>- If a baby sleeps with his butt up in the air, it means he wants another sibling.<br>- If you play with your food you will become poor later.<br>- If you tummy is flicked, then you will get a stomach ache.<br>- If you sleep a lot, then you will grow faster.<br>- If you move your legs too much (nervously), then you will be unlucky and you will drop your money.<br>- If you lie in the same position too much when you are a baby you will have a flat head (This happened to Shanna she says).<br>- It would be nice to have a zipper on my body so we can see my internal organs. Shanna is sure that hers are different from everyone elses.<br>- If you don't get enough rest after a pregnancy, your feet will be bad when you get older.<br>- If you get surprised while you are making an ugly face, it will stay that way.<br>- If you try too hard while making a bowel movement, you could hemhorage and have your insides come out. If this happens, the only way to fix it is to roll a warm hard-boiled egg around your anus until whatever came out goes back inside.<br>- Never put anything white (like a white T-shirt) on your head because it would be very unlucky.<br>- Elephants remember; tigers forget.<br>- If you eat watermellon seeds, then you will grow hot inside. This will cause eye-goop to form in your eyes.<br>- If a fortune teller comes to you, then what they have to say to you will come true.<br>- If, on the other hand, you go to the fortune teller, then what they tell you will not come true.<br>- If a pregnant woman likes to eat sour things, then she will have a boy. If she likes to eat sweet things during her pregnancy, then she will have a girl.<br>- If sick do not go outside in the rain, or take a shower.<br><br></span><i><span style="font-size:14">Since a lot of her sayings have to do with hair, skin, and dream interpretation, I though they were worth having separate sections:</span></i><span style="font-size:14"><br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">Hair</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>- Chest hair implies bigger and stronger.<br>- If you squeeze grapefruit juice onto your head then your hair will grow faster.<br>- If you move your arms around a lot, then your armpit hair will grow faster. In fact, it will become long overnight.<br>- A woman tends to lose hair while pregnant.<br>- Thinking too much can make you go bald.<br>- If a baby has 2 hair swirls on top of his head it means he will be stubborn.<br>- Blow drying your hair causes baldness. Other statements on this page may be open to debate, but this one is fact.<br>- Having a long hair in your eyebrow is good luck. Under no circumstances should you remove it. My husband had one and he removed it.<br>- If you have naturally curly hair you can never be rich.<br>- If you shave your hair off, then your hair will grow faster.<br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">Skin<br></span></b><span style="font-size:14">- If you have many &quot;flowers&quot; (swirling patterns) on your finger tips, then you will be good at art.</span><b><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></b><span style="font-size:14">- Eating chocolate or watermelon can give you pimples.<br>- If you eat tapioka, all your pimples will go away.<br>- If you get too little sleep then you will get more pimples.<br>- Eating carrots will make your skin yellow.<br>- If you drink too much coffee, you will turn black.<br>- If you eat a lot of mangos, then your skin will become that color.<br>- If you eat a lot of a food with a distinctive color, then your skin will become that color.<br>- A mole on your cheeck means that you will be part of a sad love story - hence you must remove it immediately.<br>- If you have a mole on your shoulder, then this means you will have to carry a big responsibility.<br>- If you have a mole on your lip it means you will eat 24 hours a day.<br>- If you have 3 moles on the back of your leg it means you will become king. <br>- If you have a hot temper, you will get pimples.<br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">Dream Interpretation</span></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>- If you dream taht a family member dies, then it means a new member will be joining shortly.<br>- If you dream about water it means that money will be coming in shortly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></td>
