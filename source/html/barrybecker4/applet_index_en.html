&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this page you can run some of the java programs that I have developed. You can access them either as <a href="http://java.sun.com/applets/">applet</a>s or through <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-136112.html">java Web Start</a>.  To run the applets, you need to have Browser that supports java and has the java 1.6+ plugin. Not all of the features of these programs are available when run as unsigned applets, but most are. Send me e-mail if you have any difficulties. Many of the applets may require java 1.6+ so they can take advantage of the concurrency libraries.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can group my programs into 3 main categories: games, simulations, and puzzles. I have created an infrastructure for creating games with perfect information (no chance involved). This makes it very easy to add new games of this type in the future. So far I have Pente, Tic-tac-toe, Checkers, Chess, Blockade, Set, Galactic, Poker, and Go, but could add more easily. The Go program still has a lot of room for improvement. Most of the games and simulations have an automatic optimization mode where they can improve by running repeatedly. All the two player games on this page use the strategy design pattern for determining how to search. This means it is easy to plug in alternative search algorithms. So far, I have implemented minimax, negamax, negascout, negamax with memory, negascout with memory, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTD-f">MTD-f</a>, and <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?UCT">UCT</a>. Go may probably require a very different search strategy in order to be successful, but for now these methods provide a good starting point. If you look in the options you will see a way to show a visualization of the game tree while you are playing. This has proved instrumental while debugging, but also can be used to help understand how the computer "thinks". <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider all of the programs here to be works in progress.  I have ideas all the time about things to simulate on the computer. I find it fascinating to discover how the computer can be used to solve problems. For some fraction of my ideas, I create implementations. I have only limited time on the weekends. All of the html pages in this section of the site are generated using an Ant script though I would like to move to <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a> soon. I have internationalized my source code and partially localized to 4 languages: <a href="applet_index_en.html">English</a>, <a href="applet_index_de.html">German</a>, <a href="applet_index_vi.html">Vietnamese</a>, <a href="applet_index_jp.html">Japanese</a>. At some point I hope to opensource the code and write a book about the experience of developing these programs. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you will have half as much fun playing with these programs as I had writing them!

<h2>Pente</h3>
Try to win by getting five in a row before the computer does. I used to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente">pente</a> a lot with my wife when we first met (she is quite good at it). Pente is the first game that I created using my game framework.  I first created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> version back in 1991, but this one is better. My motivation has been to make it good enough to beat my wife. The object of the game is to get 5 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). As with all the games created using this framework, you can play against the computer, another person, or have the computer play against itself.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run as <a href="games/pente_en.html">applet</a> or <a href="games/pente_en.jnlp">webstart</a>.<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><a href="games/pente_en.jnlp"><img src="games/pente_applet.jpg" title="Pente" alt="Pente" style="width: 285px; height: 185px;"></a>

<h2>Blockade</h3>
<a href=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2559/blockade>Blockade</a> is a relatively new game created by Lakeside. I used to play it as a kid, but I don't see it in the stores anymore. Each player starts with two pawns on designated spaces near their side of the board. They each have (typically) ten blue walls and ten green walls, which fit in the slots between the grid squares and are two squares wide. A player's turn consists of moving his pawn two spaces and then placing a wall anywhere on the grid. The object is to get one of your pawns around the obstacles being set by your opponent and onto one of his or her starting spaces. It is illegal to block a pawn completely from being able to reach either goal.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run as <a href="games/blockade_en.html">applet</a> or <a href="games/blockade_en.jnlp">webstart</a>.<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><a href="games/blockade_en.jnlp"><img src="games/blockade_applet.jpg" title="Blockade" alt="Blockade" style="width: 285px; height: 185px;"></a>

A set is 3 cards that are all the same or all different for the 4 attributes: color, shape, texture, and number. When you see a set, click on the player to claim it, then select the three cards you think are a set. Be careful - you lose a point if you are wrong (but cannot go below 0). There is no computer player in this game because it would be too easy for it to win.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run as <a href="games/set_en.html">applet</a> or <a href="games/set_en.jnlp">webstart</a>.<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><a href="games/set_en.jnlp"><img src="games/set_applet.jpg" title="Set Game" alt="Set Game" style="width: 285px; height: 185px;"></a>

<h2>Red Puzzle</h3>

It is very hard because every piece has four nubs. There are no edge pieces. There are over 300,000 incorrect configurations. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brute force solver will solve it in about 5,000 - 60,000 iterations. It shuffles the pieces so there is a different result each time. The search algorithm tries pieces until it finds one that doesn't fit. If none of the remaining pieces fit after all rotations have been tried, it backtracks one position and tries again. Its guaranteed to find a puzzlePanel if there is one. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brute force was too slow, so created other solvers that use concurrency and genetic algorthm search to make finding the solution much faster/ <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The letters indicate the shape of the nub: Heart, Diamond, Club or Spade.

<h2>Sudoku Puzzle</h3>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</a> is the latest puzzle craze. I'm not all that good at solving them by hand, so I wrote a program to do it. My mother and I created the design together. She used to be a programmer at Bell Labs and plays sudoku quite a bit. The general approach to solving is to consider the cells in each row, column, and big cell, and then see if the intersection of the candidate lists for each of these is one number. If so, fill it in. When you've done that for all cells, repeat. It usually only takes a few iterations to find the solution. Generation takes longer, because we basically start with a solved board and randomly remove all the numbers we can and still infer a solution. This means we have to solve the whole board each time we remove a number.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run as <a href="games/sudoku_en.html">applet</a> or <a href="games/sudoku_en.jnlp">webstart</a>.<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><a href="games/sudoku_en.jnlp"><img src="games/sudoku_applet.jpg" title="Sudoku Puzzle" alt="Sudoku Puzzle" style="width: 285px; height: 185px;"></a>

<h2>Hi-Q</h3>
<a href="http://www.educationallearninggames.com/hi-q.asp">Hi-Q</a> is another one of those games that can be very frustrating without the aid of a computer. The object is to have only 1 peg in the center position when you are done. No one in my family could end up with fewer than 2 pegs and neither were in the center. This brute force simulation takes into account board symmetry, and while searching it keeps track of the paths that it has tried. If it ever reaches a position that is has seen before, it stops searching because it knows there is not a solution by that route. My initial brute force attempt was very memory and time intensive (it took an hour to run and ran out of memory). Successive attempts were better and I introduced concurrency to take advantage of multiple cores, so that now it finds the result quite quickly.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run as <a href="games/hiq_en.html">applet</a> or <a href="games/hiq_en.jnlp">webstart</a>.<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><a href="games/hiq_en.jnlp"><img src="games/hiq_applet.jpg" title="Hi-Q" alt="Hi-Q" style="width: 285px; height: 185px;"></a>

<h2>Snake</h3>
Simulate a living snake. The program uses a spring based model to represent the snake. There is a sinusoidal force function applied to each side to simulate muscular contractions. Directional friction is used to make the snake go forward (as happens with a real snake). Snakes have 4 ways of moving: rectilinear progression, horizontal undulatory progression, sindwinding, and concertina progression (rarely used). I only used the most common gait, horizontal undulatory progression, in this demo, but will probably add the others. You can also change the parameters of this gait to get different behaviors. The snake "learns" to move more efficiently by a process of automated optimization. It uses exactly the optimization code I use for improving the performance of the game programs. I now understand really well how a snake moves.

<h2>Stock Price Simulation</h3>
This simulation was motivated by the <a href="http://www.barrybecker4.com/puzzle_answers.html">following problem</a>.<br/>You invest $100,000 in a volatile stock. Each year, with equal probability, it either rises 60% or falls by 40%. You declare that your heirs are not to sell the stock for 100 years. What would be the expected stock value (mean) after 100 years? What would be  the median? What would be the mode?<br/> The expected value would be $1,378,000,000. If there are many stocks like this, the total market value will rise dramatically (value = expected * num_stocks)<br/>100,000 * ((1.6+0.6)/2)^100 = 100,000 * 1.1^100 <br/>The mode and the median are both $13,000 (100,000 * (1.6)^50 * (0.6)^50). <br/>While on average you expect a 10% return a year, the most likely scenario (mode) is that you'll end up with $13,000. Moreover, more than half the people will end up with $13,000 or less. The moral of the story is Diversify!
