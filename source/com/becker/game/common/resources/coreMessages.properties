MTD_NEGAMAX_SEARCH_TIP = Memory enhanced test drive that calls out to negamax.
UCT_SEARCH = Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) Search
UCT_SEARCH_TIP = UCT is quite different that the others. It relies on a monte carlo method to adaptively expand search.
MOVES_TO_LOOKAHEAD = Moves to look ahead (1 easy - 6 difficult and slow):
MOVES_TO_LOOKAHEAD_TIP = This controls how well the computer will play. If quiescence is on, then the look ahead may be greater thatn this for selected paths.
PERCENTAGE_AT_PLY = Percentage of best moves to at each ply (5-100):
PERCENTAGE_AT_PLY_TIP = The percentage of moves to consider at each ply. \nThese are the top moves using static evaluation. \nIf small percentage then the game will run faster.
UPPER_BOUND = The upper bound for the size of the game tree is :
USE_PRUNING = Use alpha beta pruning
USE_PRUNING_TIP = this will eliminate many branches in the game tree - improving performance significantly
PERCENT_LESS_THAN_BEST_THRESH = Limit to moves greater than this percent less than the best
PERCENT_LESS_THAN_BEST_THRESH_TIP = Only moves that are greater than this percent lest than the score of the best move in the list will be considered.
USE_QUIESCENCE = Use quiescence
USE_QUIESCENCE_TIP = Quiescence means we will pursue certain paths further until we can confirm that they are stable (i.e. quiet).
MAX_NUM_SIMULATIONS = Maximum number of simulations
MAX_NUM_SIMULATIONS_TIP = Runs random simulations to converge on optimal next move.
RANDOM_LOOK_AHEAD = Number of random moves when playing random game
RANDOM_LOOK_AHEAD_TIP = The number of semi-random moves to play from the starting state in a simulated random game. We choose the moves randomly from a set of good moves.
EXPLORE_EXPLOIT_RATIO = Ratio of exploration to exploitation
EXPLORE_EXPLOIT_RATIO_TIP = The larger this number is the more exploration the search does; smaller will do more exploitation of known good moves; balanced around 1.0.
MIN_BEST_MOVES = Minimum best moves to consider
MIN_BEST_MOVES_TIP = Don't consider fewer than this many of the best moves when searching for the next move
DEBUG_OPTIONS = Debugging Options
