        <description>
 The double door is unlocked and opens easily.
 The beam of your flashligh reveals an empty hallway with a mirror at the opposite end. 
 There are openings that lead to rooms on the right and left.
 The hall has inch-thick red carpeting and walnut-paneled walls. 
 The mirror at the end runs from the floor to the twenty-foot-high ceiling
 and covers the forty feet of wall section on that south face of the hall.

There are leaves on the floor, and an old worn out couch in the north east corner.
There is a musty smell to the room, and leaves are littered on the floor. The couch is an old, dusty, overstuffed relic with several cushions and rips on all parts of it.
The room measures sixty feet east and west and forty feet north and south, if paced out. There is a door on the east side of the room.

Rats com out from under the couch and attack you. One bites you and gives you a terrible disease.

        <description>
The beam of your flashlight show a hall with pink walls and a floor of red marble. The walls have clean squares all over them where pictures were obviously once hung, but are no longer. The floor has dried leaves littering it. If paced out, the hall is eighty feet long east and west and twenty feet long north and south. The hall leads to another room at the end.

        <description>
The beam of the flashlight shows a room with gray painted walls and a cement floor. It is filled with wooden crates and there are leaves all over the room in large piles.
There are 200 empty wooden crates of differing sizes, and the biggest concentration of leaves is in the southwest corner of the room.  The room measures sixty feet east and west and forty feet north and south and has a side alcove to the south starting on the east wall that is forty feet long east and west and twenty feet long north and south. It is here that the concentration of leaves is located. Behind a big crate along the east wall, thirty feet from the north corner, one finds a door with a normal handle.

        <description>
   The beam of your flashlight shows a room with gray painted walls and a cement floor. It is filled with boxes and barrels.
   There are thirteen barrels of grain alcohol each with the number "50" painted on it. There are thirteen boxes filled with pairs of white gloves. A metal chest contains a silver set made to serve eighteen people, four pairs of silver candlesticks, three huge silver carving knives (like short swords), and eighteen solid silver goblets (total worth of the silver items is 20,000 silver pieces).
There are thirteen chests filled with books about plants; thirteen boxes filled with assorted sizes of clay pots; and ten large crates with mattresses in them. When paced out, the room is forty feet wide east and west and sixty feet wide north and south.
A door on the east wall is originally hidden by the mattress crates.
    When you enter the room, you are immediately attacked by an incredibly old man dressed in rags and carrying a butcher knife (HP: 7; #AT: 1; 0: 1-6; AC: 10; SA:None). This old man leaps out from behind some of the boxes and surprises you.
