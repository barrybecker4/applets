/**
 * Defines everything the computer needs to know to play Poker.
 *
 * ToDo list
 *  - for chat, you should only chat with those at your table if you are in a game, else chat only with those not in a game.
 * - something screwed up adding players out of order
 * - fix TrivialMarker not showing number.
 * - All players should have an action that they perform (for all games. This action is like a move in a 2 player game.)
 * - add host and port to game options
 * - use real faces for players
 *
 *  - options dialog
 *     - Texas holdem
 *     - N card stud
 *          - num cards for each
 *          - whether to use jokers
 *          - allow n exchanges
 *          - raise limit (eg $20)
 *   - summary dlg
 *      - show who gets pot
 *      - show the pot
 *      - give option to start another round with same players
 *      - unless really done, only then can you exit.
 *
 *  bugs
 *     - at end of game the winning players winnings are not added to his cash.
 *     - robot player keeps adding last raise amount even though competitor is calling.
 *     - Raise amount not always matched! seems to happen in a multiplayer game when robots involved.
 *       this is because it should only include the callAmount if the player has not already gone.
