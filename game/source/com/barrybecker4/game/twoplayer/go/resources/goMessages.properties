GO_OVERVIEW = Go is a game with simple rules, but can take a lifetime to master.\n\
   These are the rules:\n\
     1) Players alternate placing immovable stones. \n\
        Black moves first unless he starts with some number of handicap stones. \n\
     2) When a group of stones is completely surrounded they are captured.\n\
        Each capture counts as 1 point at the end.\n\
     3) Players can pass at any time. When both pass consecutively, the game is over.\n\
     4) The board cannot look like it did at any time in the past (rule of ko)\n\
     5) Scoring: Every capture and every empty space completely surrounded by a group \n\
        of stones of one color counts as a point.\n\
 \n\
